I use photography to save moments that I don’t want to forget. I take pictures of my family, my friends, places I go and things that are important to me. Most of my photos are very important to me since they are memories that I made throughout my life and mostly everyday moments. When I take pictures I feel like I am saving an important memory and every time I look at it, it brings back happy times and makes me remember the good old days. Photography really helps me notice things more like small details, like someone smiling or making face expressions and instead of scrolling through the photos I take my time remembering the fun times from the photos.

	As it mentions in “In Plato Cave” how Sontag explains photographs allow people to “collect the world” and preserve moments that would otherwise disappear. This connects to how I use photography to save memories of my family, friends, and important experiences. She also describes photographs as both a “pseudo-presence and a token of absence,” which probably means pictures make us feel close to people and moments even when they are gone or far away, which relates to how sharing photos helps me stay connected with others.

	Photography also helps me feel more confident. When I take a picture I like, it feels good to create something on my own. It teaches me patience, because sometimes I have to wait for the right moment with a good angle. Photography also helps me notice change over time, like how people grow, places change, or seasons pass. Looking at older photos reminds me that life doesn’t stay the same, and that change is normal. Taking pictures helps me understand my own growth and how my life is slowly moving forward.

	I also use photography to stay connected with family and friends. Sharing pictures is an easy way to show people what I am doing and how my life looks. Showing a picture can explain something faster than words and it helps people to feel closer even if they are far away. Pictures help people feel closer, even if they are far away or I don’t see them often. I often send photos to my friends and family to let them know how I was and what I've been up to and sharing these photos makes me still feel connected to them. Photography makes it easier to share moments. Big or small and helps relationships stay strong even when people are apart. Also photography helps me express myself without having to take a lot. Sometimes I don’t know how to explain my feelings, but pictures can show them. Taking photos makes me feel creative and gives me a way to tell my story. Even simple pictures can mean a lot because they capture real moments from my life. Photography helps me see my world differently and appreciate things I might normally overlook
<br>
	If I had to show what the world is like right now using pictures or drawing, I would probably focus on everyday moments that people usually ignore, like I would take pictures of messy rooms, crowded streets, empty classrooms and people rushing from one place to another. These moments would show how busy and stressful life can feel even when nothing big is happening around us. However there are other ways to show the world something small and meaningful, like people laughing, sunlight and people spending time together. These moments would show that even though the world can feel overwhelming. 
<br>
	Photography is important to me because it helps me remember my life and share it with the people I care about. It helps me slow down and notice things I might forget. Taking pictures helps me keep memories that I don’t want to lose.
