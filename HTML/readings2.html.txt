In her article, Nesrine Malik talks about how AI is changing the way we see the world. She calls it “AI slop,” which means low-quality images and videos made by computers. Some of this content is silly, like cartoon pictures or fantasy landscapes, but some is more serious and can trick people. AI makes it hard to know what is real and what is fake because there is so much of it online.

A big problem with AI slop is politics. Malik says there are videos and images showing made-up events, like politicians winning or losing in ways that never happened. These fake things are shared on apps like WhatsApp, where people trust the sender. This makes it easy for false information to spread. AI can make pictures and videos look very real, so it is hard to tell the difference between truth and lies.

AI slop can also be biased. Malik explains that AI uses old data to make images, so it often shows stereotypes about race, gender, and families. For example, some AI pictures show traditional families or women in certain roles, making it seem like these ideas are normal or better. This can affect how people think about society and politics without even realizing it.

Not all AI content is political. A lot of it is just made to get clicks and attention. Social media companies like cheap and fast AI content because it makes people scroll and share more. This means people see a mix of random, exaggerated, or silly images along with real news. Even serious events can feel like entertainment because of this. Over time, people get used to seeing so many images and videos that it becomes hard to focus on what is important.

Besides bias and political content, a lot of AI slop is just nonsense made to get clicks and attention. Social media companies often prefer this cheap, fast content because it keeps users scrolling, sharing, and reacting. This creates an internet filled with random, exaggerated, or meaningless images that flood our attention and make it hard to focus on important events. Even serious news can feel like entertainment when it’s presented alongside cute or shocking AI-generated images. The result is that people become desensitized and confused, unable to tell what is urgent or real.
<br>
Malik’s main point is that AI slop is changing how we see the world. It spreads fake information, encourages biased ideas, and distracts people from real problems. Even though AI can be fun and creative, it can also confuse people and make them believe things that aren’t true. She warns that we need to be careful and think about what we see online, instead of just believing everything.
<br>
In short, AI slop might look harmless or funny, but it can be dangerous for the people. It makes it hard to know what is real, spreads misinformation, and affects the way we think. We have to be smart about what we look at online so we don’t get tricked.
