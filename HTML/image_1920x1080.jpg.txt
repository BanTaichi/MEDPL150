I picked this image because the building has a lot of repeating balconies and windows that catch your eye right away. When I cropped it to 1920 × 1080, I tried to keep the middle balconies centered so the picture would look balanced and not tilted to one side. The straight vertical lines of the building mixed with the flat horizontal balcony lines make the photo more interesting instead of boring. I also liked how the glass on the balconies reflects light differently than the walls, which adds more detail and texture. I adjusted the brightness and shadows a little so the windows and edges stood out more and didn’t look dull. Overall, the photo is interesting because of the patterns, balance, and contrast between light and dark areas.
